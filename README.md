# Yelpcamp-Full-stack-Website
This is a camping website that can be used by clients as well as individuals to book camping sites across all world

*Project description
*It's my own version of Yelcamp prepared under the complete web developer bootcamp course by Colt Steele.The idea of this project is to provide a platform where where clients can get reviews about various campgrounds situated around them ,they can tally their prices,their facilities,locations ,book campgrounds and also give reviews.Companies on the other hand can advertise their campgrounds .
1) Having used node.js in server-side i have used RESTful Routing with CRUD functionality
2)Used MONGODB along with mongoose ODM.
3)For client-side used bootstrap,CSS and HTML.
4)Used MAPBOX API for mapping location of campgrounds.
5)Used STRIPE API for transactions and booking of campgrounds.
